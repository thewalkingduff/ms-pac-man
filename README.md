<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

I will be updating it to have the food totally disappear after she eats it.  When she gets to the other side all the food and Inky the ghost will reappear so she can go back and eat them again.
Someday I would like to revamp the whole site and make something close to the real Ms. Pac-Man game with my own custom funky art.  No quarters will be needed to play. üòâ
